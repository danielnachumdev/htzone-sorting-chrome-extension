## Introduction

Welcome to the htzone sorting extension ("the Extension"), a browser extension designed to enhance your browsing experience on htzone.co.il by adding product sorting capabilities. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of any information when you use our Extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The htzone sorting extension is designed to operate entirely on your local browser (client-side).

-   **No Data Collection:** The Extension does not collect, record, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data or information.
-   **No Tracking:** The Extension does not track your browsing activity across the web. Its functionality is strictly limited to the htzone.co.il domain as specified in the extension's manifest.
-   **Local Operation:** All sorting operations and manipulations of website content are performed locally on your computer. No information about the products you view or your sorting preferences is sent to any external servers.

## Permissions

The Extension requires permission to access and modify the content of `https://www.htzone.co.il/subcategory/*` pages. This permission is essential for the Extension to add the sorting dropdown and reorder the products on the page as you select different sorting options. The Extension does not use this permission for any other purpose.
