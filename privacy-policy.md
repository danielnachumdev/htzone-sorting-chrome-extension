# Privacy Policy for htzone sorting extension

**Last Updated:** 2024-07-28

## Introduction

Welcome to the htzone sorting extension ("the Extension"), a browser extension designed to enhance your browsing experience on htzone.co.il by adding product sorting capabilities. This Privacy Policy is intended to inform you about our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of any information when you use our Extension.

## Data Collection and Usage

We are committed to protecting your privacy. The htzone sorting extension is designed to operate entirely on your local browser (client-side).

-   **No Data Collection:** The Extension does not collect, record, store, transmit, or sell any of your personal data or information beyond what is strictly necessary for its functionality (see "User Preferences" below).
-   **No Tracking:** The Extension does not track your browsing activity across the web. Its functionality is strictly limited to the htzone.co.il domain, specifically the `/subcategory/*` and `/sale/*` pages, as specified in the extension's manifest.
-   **Local Operation:** All sorting operations and manipulations of website content are performed locally on your computer. No information about the products you view or your sorting preferences is sent to any external servers.
-   **No Analytics or External Requests:** The Extension does not use analytics, make external API requests, or communicate with any third-party servers.

## User Preferences

The Extension allows you to enable or disable its functionality using a toggle in the extension popup. This preference (whether the extension is enabled or disabled) is stored using Chrome's `chrome.storage.sync` feature. This means your preference may be synced across devices where you are signed into Chrome, but no other information is stored or transmitted.

## Permissions

The Extension requires the following permissions:

-   **Access to htzone.co.il pages:** The Extension operates only on `https://www.htzone.co.il/subcategory/*` and `https://www.htzone.co.il/sale/*` pages. This permission is essential for the Extension to add the sorting dropdown and reorder the products on the page as you select different sorting options. The Extension does not use this permission for any other purpose.
-   **Storage:** Used solely to save your enable/disable preference for the Extension.
-   **Tabs:** Used to reload the current tab when you change the enable/disable setting from the popup, so changes take effect immediately. The Extension does not access or collect any information about your tabs beyond this functionality.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
